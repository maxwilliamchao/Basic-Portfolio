This assignment introduced me to programming fundamentals in HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).  I enjoyed working on CSS with others after class because it was interesting to see the many different approaches people take to get the same result.  It was frustrating at times but rewarding when things worked.  I was shown pictures of a simple website and reproduced it as best I could with what I know.
